From __embedded firmware__ to user interfaces, from cutting-edge __scientific computing__ to database management,
I've successfully developed a wide range of innovative software in a variety of industries.

The oldest have been running for over 15 years and are still providing __great value to happy users__.

## Fields of expertise

### Mobile robotics

See my dedicated [robotics page](./robotics.html).

### Computer vision

From simple object detection to complex configurations that require the crossed fields of view of multiple cameras,
I'm able to solve challenging problems by __mastering the fundamentals__ of computer vision:

* camera calibration
* image processing algorithms
* detection, positioning and measurement of remote objects
* conversion between various 2D/3D reference frames involved

### Test stations

By building automated test stations for various industries, I have enabled them to:

* measure and improve the __quality of their products__
* make their processes more __cost-effective and productive__
* ensure compliance with their regulatory specifications

My expertise in this field has proved beneficial to several industries:

* railway equipments manufacturer
* tires manufacturer

### Code quality

With over two decades of experience in a wide variety of backgrounds,
I master a full range of skills to produce high quality software:

* quickly explore and understand __complex code bases__
* investigate, reproduce, document and fix bugs in existing code bases
* create or refactor code to make it __simple, readable and maintainable__
* identify performance bottlenecks and make __appropriate optimizations__
* create or adapt tests to ensure __code reliability__
