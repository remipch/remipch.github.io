I'm able to design and produce custom printed circuit boards.

## Relays test bench

At [Idtsoft](http://idtsoft.fr/) I built special boards to test a complete set of relays for the SNCF.

The principle was to generate some specific electrical signals, apply them to the correct relay contact
and measure the response:

* commutation times
* switching currents
* contact conductivities
* dielectric strength
* response to particular electrical configurations

# Solar concentrator

I've developed an interface card for my
[solar concentrator](./solar.html).
